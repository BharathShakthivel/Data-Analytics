# 🏙️ Urban Planning in Brazil – Tableau Visualization Project

This project presents an interactive, data-driven exploration of urban planning indicators in Brazilian cities using **Tableau**. It focuses on uncovering regional disparities, economic concentration, infrastructure gaps, and development inequalities through a modern and interactive dashboard.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Data Visualization module (B9DA106)**. The objective was to build two interactive dashboards using diverse chart types to explore urban planning metrics including:

- Human Development Index (IDHM)
- GDP per capita
- Infrastructure and housing
- Tourism and mobility
- Public service availability

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Tableau Visualization 1.twbx` | Tableau workbook file containing both dashboards |
| `Critical_Analysis_Report.pdf` | Detailed critical analysis report (~2000 words) |
| `BRAZIL_CITIES_REV2022.CSV` | Dataset used for visualizations |
| `Data_Dictionary.csv` | Description of dataset fields |


## 📌 Dashboards & Visualizations

The Tableau workbook includes:

### Dashboard 1: Urban Development Overview
- **Bar Chart:** GDP per Capita by State
- **Scatter Plot:** Rural Housing vs Human Development Index
- **Dual-Axis Chart:** Hotels vs Beds by Region
- **Box Plot:** Postal Services vs Development
- **Donut Chart:** Economic Contribution by Sector

### Dashboard 2: Mobility, Tourism & Public Services
- **Symbol Map:** Vehicle Ownership vs Population
- **Filled Map:** IDHM by City
- **Interactive Filters & Tooltips:** Regional/State insights

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Economic activity is concentrated in a few southern states.
- Less developed cities have limited postal and transport services.
- Vehicle distribution does not scale directly with population.
- Mid-tier tourism regions show underutilized potential.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Tableau Desktop 2024**
- **Python (for preprocessing)** 
- **CSV Dataset (IBGE & Tourism data)**
