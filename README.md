# Data-Analytics

This repository showcases a collection of data analytics projects Iâ€™ve worked on, demonstrating my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization. 
Each project involves extracting insights from real-world datasets using tools like Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn), SQL, and Excel. 
The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, support data-driven decision-making, and solve business problems across various domains such as telecom, healthcare, and finance.
