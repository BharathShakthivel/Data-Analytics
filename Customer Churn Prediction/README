Customer Churn Prediction for the Telecom Industry
Overview
Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, companies can identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) and take proactive measures to retain them.

Key Aspects
Industry Relevance

Telecom: High competition and customer switching make churn prediction essential.
Finance: Banks and insurance companies use similar models to predict customer retention.
SaaS Companies: Subscription-based businesses benefit from churn analysis to reduce customer loss.
Tech Stack

Python: For data processing and modeling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and exploratory analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Power BI : For data visualization and reporting insights to stakeholders.


Workflow
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Customer demographics, call records, billing information, complaints, etc.
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding key factors influencing churn.
Identifying correlations and patterns in the data.
Machine Learning Modeling:

Training models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Churn Prediction & Insights:

Predicting high-risk customers.
Providing actionable insights to reduce churn (e.g., offering discounts, better customer service).
Dashboard & Reporting:

Using Power BI to visualize trends and predictions.
Enabling decision-makers to act on insights.
Business Impact
Reduced customer churn rates.
Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Increased revenue and operational efficiency.
This project is highly valuable for any customer-centric industry looking to enhance retention strategies using data-driven approaches.

It is more like a small capstone project that will help us get grips with the current tools and technologies.
